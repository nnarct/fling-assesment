# Code Explain

This project contains JavaScript files, each with a specific function, along with an [`index.js`](index.js) file that imports and tests these functions.

## JavaScript Files

- [`prime.js`](prime.js): This file contains a function to check if a given number is prime or not. It returns `true` if the number is prime, and `false` otherwise.

- [`longestWord.js`](longestWord.js): This file contains a function to find the longest word from an array that is also a concatenated word from the same array.

- [`lis.js`](lis.js): This file contains a function to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array.

- [`addUp.js`](addUp.js): This file contains a function that finds two numbers from a given array that add up to the given target number `k`.

- [`fibonacci.js`](fibonacci.js): This file contains a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length.
